			<p>
				The software industry has been abuzz lately with the new wave of AI. For the
				first time ever, LLMs are available to the public market, such as OpenAI's
				ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Simultaneously, exciting people about the array
				of new opportunities and worring workers about the thought of becoming
				obsolute. Personally, if I read one more aticle about how AI will replace all
				knowledge workers, I'll rip the cord from my WiFi router. This is not one of
				those blogs. I called this blog "The End of Software" because I believe the
				way we will produce software will fundementally change forever with the use of
				AI code generation. Hot take I know. With the use of AI, software will cease
				to be an industry based off the quality of the laborer. The software quality
				will no longer be a direct indication of experience or skill. AI will give
				programmers and non-technical folk alike the ability to produce "good enough"
				code to get the job done in most situations. So to compensate, software will
				be an industry more focused on process than individual skill.To be clear, I
				don't believe less jobs in software will exist and I don't believe all
				knowledge work will cease to exist. In fact, AI will produce more jobs and
				greater opportunities for most people.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a preface, I'm a professional who works in the software industry therefore
				I have a vested interested in how it develops. Further, I'm not in the
				predication business, so this is really just conjecture. I wouldn't place any
				bets on these predications coming true, I really just wanted to spend some
				time reflecting on how building software will change.
			</p>
			<p>All that said, let's get to it.</p>
			<h1 id="thebenefits">The Benefits</h1>
			<p>
				AI, at the current moment, is the best pair programmer in the world. It can
				generate boilerplate in seconds, give you comments on how your code can
				improvem and point out potential vulnerabilities with the code. The code it
				produced is flawed and the suggestions are not always correct, but both these
				things can be said of most juniors and the least skilled programmer at your
				office. Once you test the results and see it is unsatisfactory, you'll just go
				back to the AI to generate more code or tweak it yourself. In this scenario,
				the AI has solved the most expensive and time-consuming part of the problem,
				getting started.Editing code, even though tediuos, is often faster the first
				go around than trying to map out the entire system in your head. Also, this
				will really help folks who get stuck in the planning process of coding, now
				building the first draft takes seconds not days.
			</p>
			<p>
			    There is some worry that AI will make everyone code
			    <a href="https://www.gitclear.com/coding_on_copilot_data_shows_ais_downward_pressure_on_code_quality">worse</a>,
				but I think the worse code is code that is never written. There are so many
			    features that don't get built simply due to the fact that developers current
			    don't have the time to buid them. With AI, increasing the productive capacity
			    of the average developer, there will be a lot more value delivered for users.
			    That in my opinion, is worth the decrease in code quality we might be seeing
			    in the neat term. That doesn't even take into account the fact that LLMs can
			    get better over time. So it won't always be the case the code quality produced
			    by AI will be low.
			</p>
			<p>
				AI could also generate unit test much more quickly and consistently than a
				developer. Unit tests are often don't help you understand all the difficult
				parts of a system so if the AI could generate those tests the developer can
				spend more time on higher value tasks like integration testing and automation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon working with AI, I don't think it's direct competition is with developers
				but with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>. Any developer
				will tell you the stack has been immensly helpful in their career, both in
				gaining an understanding of the tech, answering specific implementation
				questions or providing code that can be copied straight into production. I
				mean, let he who hasn't copied something they haven't fully understood from
				stackoverflow cast the first stone. AI can provide more targeted examples to
				developers about solving there problems without the stigma you find on the
				stack
			</p>
			<p>
				The average stack overflow<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/qcdh4c/stack_overflow_in_a_nutshell/">experience</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally I think AI, will make finding application vulnerabilities much faster.
				Thinking of complicated edge cases is half the battle, which AI can help with.
				Plus once the vulnerability is identified, AI can help code the solution.
			</p>
			<h1 id="theimplications">The Implications</h1>
			<p>
				A lot of resistance to AI is from programmers who have a lot to lose if AI
				becomes commonplace. That's not to say there aren't good arguments against the
				current iteration of AI, but all of them are solvable. I think a of the
				resistance comes down to people not liking the idea of change and being scared
				that there place in the world is going to change. After all, AI will be a
				change equal in magnitude to any previous work revolution.
			</p>
			<p>
				I think to get a better understanding of how if AI is transformational and
				what will become of programmer in society not just the workplace, we have to
				look at huge work transformations in the past. Analysizing those past tech
				revolutions will give insight into the current AI revolution. For example of a
				similar situation look at late eighteenth and early nineteenth century United
				States, and the rest of the world for that matter. In these societies, skilled
				works were known as artisans. There labor was expensive and difficult to
				reproduce making them highly sought after and well-compensated in comparision
				to less skilled workers, much like programmer and software engineers are
				today. Then during the Industrial Revolution, the advent of new technology
				meant that the average skilled worker could produce quality similar to that of
				an artisan and at a higher rate.
			</p>
			<p>
				This lead to what was considering <em>deskilling</em> in labor circles and by
				labor economists. Where the barrier to entry fell leading to a higher supply
				of labor, suppressing wages for these skilled artisans. In laymans termns, no
				longer could an artisan charge high prices because newer less skilled workers
				could complete the same work while demanding a lower price. The Industrial
				Revolution did eliminate some niche jobs, but also created a huge score of
				professions. Not to mention there are now more weavers, bricklayers and
				manufactoring workers world-wide then before the industrial revolution.
			</p>
			<p>
				The collorallary to modern AI developed code should be clear. AI will might
				eliminate some hyper-niche positions but on the whole it will create more jobs
				and value than it will destroy. Once AIs becomes "good enough" producing code
				will become the job of anyone with language skills. The code produced might be
				low quality but the cost of replacing such code also goes down. Since this is
				trival, a lot of people who would have shied away from the industry will now
				be successful engineers and programmers. This is already happening with
				writers who create ad-copy. Instead of having a human write the whole thing,
				an AI model generates the first draft and a human edits the result. So future,
				AI will develop the code and the programmer will test the results, tweaking as
				needed. If this sounds foreign or impossible to you, it might be due to the
				fact your work on highly novel software. But if we're honest 90% of
				development jobs are CRUD web applications. AI surely, can produce something
				passable in this space given enough time.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main impact on programmers is they will have to learn more skills in order
				to continue to justify their high wages. If you are only a Tailwind CSS dev or
				a Java 8 dev, then AI might seem threating because of it's ability to pick up
				specific tasks quickly. So theoricitally, those devs could be replaced.
				However, the solution here is simple. These developers can use AI to learn new
				skills quickly to continue to be employed. There doesn't need to be a reason
				why they are left out from the AI revolution.
			</p>
			<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
				In short, AI will drastically improve the output of a developer and make the
				job of becoming a developer easier. More features will get built and as a
				result more value will be generated. The is some abstract worry around AI
				safety, code quality and sustainability but those things are solvable probems
				that will not stop AI from being dominant in the future work place. I think if
				you're a programmer and worried about AI taking your job, then don't be but it
				will change the nature of the work you do. It might even lead in a decrease in
				wages, but full out replacement is not an option. If you wish to keep the high
				wages that are in the industry now, then you have learn to use AI to your
				benefit or it will be to your detriment.
